# DevChallenge: Translate-app

This is a front-end web application that enables users to translate text quickly and efficiently between multiple languages. The user inputs the text, selects the desired target language, and the application communicates with a translation API to display the translated result in real time. The interface is designed to be fast, intuitive, and responsive, ensuring an easy and seamless translation experience.
